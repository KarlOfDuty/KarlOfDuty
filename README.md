### KarlofDuty's Github repositories

Hello, you can find my Github repos here. I mainly work on my Discord bots SCPDiscord and SupportBoi nowadays but do tell me if you want any updates for other things too and I'll have a look.

I have also created a lot of the repositories in the @EarthMC organisation but I am no longer active there.

If you are looking for any of my old SCP:SL ServerMod plugins I have transferred them over to the @ServerMod organisation so you can find them there.
